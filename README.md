# Ride-Hailing System ðŸš—

This is a personal side project to build an Uber-like ride-hailing system using Django. The project allows users to book rides and drivers to view and accept them. The system will feature dynamic pricing based on real-time demand.

The project is in **development** and serves as a way to learn about **scaling infrastructure**, **system optimization**, and several essential aspects of **large-scale system design**, including:

- Distributed systems
- Performance optimization
- Cloud deployment and monitoring
- Data structures and algorithms


## Features (Planned)
- User registration and authentication
- Driver registration and verification
- Ride booking and matching system
- Dynamic pricing based on demand and supply
- Ride history for users and drivers
- Real-time updates on ride status
- Notifications for ride acceptance and completion

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: MySQL & PostgreSQL (planning to explore horizontal scaling)
- **Microservices Communication**: RabbitMQ
- **Caching & Queuing**: Redis (for performance optimizations)
- **Real-time Functionality**: WebSockets (for live ride tracking)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS (Cloud setup in future development stages)

---

## Learning Goals
This project will evolve to include:
- **Scalable infrastructure**: Learning to scale a system to handle millions of users, drivers, and transactions
- **System optimization**: Improving performance with caching, query optimization, and load balancing
- **Distributed systems**: Implementing microservices and service-oriented architecture
- **Cloud deployment**: Deploying and managing the application on cloud platforms with proper monitoring and auto-scaling
- **Algorithms & Data structures**: Implementing efficient data structures for ride matching, demand forecasting, and pricing algorithms

## Future Plans
The following features and optimizations are planned for the future:
- Integration with third-party services for payments
- Real-time ride tracking using Google Maps API
- A recommendation engine to suggest rides or drivers
- A robust monitoring system with logging and error tracking
- Full cloud deployment with CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration
